    <b><u><h3 style="color:violet;">1. Balanced Stance:</h3></u></b>
    <div style="background-color:rgb(120, 71, 255);">
    <p>Posture: Rohit has a slightly open stance, which allows him to cover the ball well, particularly when facing fast bowlers. His head is still, and his eyes are focused on the ball, giving him a good sense of timing.</p>
    </div>
    <b><u><h3 style="color:crimson;">2. Elegant Drive:</h3></u></b>
    <div style="background-color:rgb(83, 255, 71);">
    <p>Rohit is particularly strong on the offside, with a classic technique for driving the ball. He often plays beautiful cover drives, using minimal foot movement but excellent timing and placement.
    His balance when playing drives is impeccable, and he ensures that his head and bat are aligned to the ball, which contributes to the purity of his strokes.</p>
    </div>
    <b><u><h3 style="color:violet;">3. Shot Selection:</h3></u></b>
    <div style="background-color:rgb(126, 71, 255);">
    <p>Rohit is known for his selective shot-making, and he often chooses to wait for the right ball to play. He doesn’t try to force shots but rather looks for opportunities to drive, cut, or pull when the ball is in his range.</p>
    <p><b>Cut and Pull:</b> Rohit’s cutting and pulling technique against short-pitched deliveries is highly effective. He is especially lethal on the backfoot, using the horizontal bat to play cut and pull shots with precision.</p>
    </div>
    <b><u><h3 style="color:rgb(238, 184, 130);">4. Timely Aggression:</h3></u></b>
    <div style="background-color:rgb(255, 141, 71);">
    <p>While Rohit can be patient, he is also known for his ability to accelerate the innings at crucial moments. His batting gears up quickly when required, especially in the middle overs of limited-overs cricket.</p>
    <p><b>Six-Hitting Ability:</b> Rohit has a remarkable ability to hit sixes, particularly during the powerplays in limited-overs cricket. His effortless six-hitting is one of his trademarks, where he uses a relaxed bat swing and impeccable timing to clear the boundary.</p>

    <div style="background-color:rgb(255, 71, 71);">
    <p>A significant feature of Rohit’s game is his backfoot play. His ability to play the ball late on the backfoot is key to his success, especially when dealing with bouncers or deliveries outside the off-stump. He is extremely comfortable cutting the ball behind square.</p>
    </div>
    <b><u><h3 style="color:brown;">6. Footwork Against Spin:</h3></u></b>
    <div style="background-color:rgb(249, 255, 71);">
    <p>Rohit’s footwork against spinners is very good, as he uses both forward and back movements, depending on the length of the ball. He often uses the sweep shot to counter spinners and has a solid defense against them.</p>
    </div>
    <b><u><h3 style="color:chartreuse;">7. Mental Toughness:</h3></u></b>
    <div style="background-color:fuchsia;">
    <p>Rohit's technique is supported by strong mental resilience. He often takes his time to settle in, particularly in Test cricket, and then starts playing his shots. His temperament allows him to stay calm under pressure, a critical aspect of his technique.</p>
    </div>
    <b><u><h3 style="color:cornflowerblue;">8. Unique Shots and Innovation:</h3></u></b>
    <div style="background-color:rgb(83, 255, 71);">
